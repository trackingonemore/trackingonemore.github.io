# Tracking One More — Placeholder Site

This is a small static placeholder site for the Tracking One More app. It contains:

- index.html — homepage with placeholders
- css/styles.css — basic responsive styling
- screenshots/placeholder.svg — placeholder image to replace with real screenshots
- reference.txt — App Store link and notes

How to use:
1. Replace placeholder screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder.
2. Update the copy in `index.html` to match the app's real description.
3. Push the files to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages, or deploy to a static host like Netlify/Vercel.
